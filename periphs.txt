List of devices and peripherals and their descriptions

Root Device:
    The root device is the brains of the SOAREDS ecosystem. The device hosts
    its own private network that all peripheral hubs connect to. It has
    expansion ports to add peripherals directly, or peripheral hubs can be
    added to the ecosystem network through the web console or the built-in
    console.

Peripheral Hubs:
    Peripheral hubs are the devices that connect to the ecosystem network. All
    peripheral hubs have at least one expansion port to add a peripheral, such
    as an interface or an outlet controller. Behaviors of peripheral hubs can
    be modified on the fly through the web console.

Peripherals:
    Peripherals are the primary I/O devices that are a part of the network.
    They run on a 2-wire (I2C) interface with the hub that they are connected
    to. Each peripheral will be designed to perform a single function, whether
    that's to turn on or off a light or control the thermostat.

    List of planned peripherals:
        Screen interface - Device that displays information about the functions
                    of the current device
        Switch controller - Device that acts like a wall switch
        Outlet controller - Device that controls the state of a wall outlet
